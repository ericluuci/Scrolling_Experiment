# Scrolling_Experiment

This prototype is written in python 2.7 and requires pygame to run.

This program is very basic in design and was written to understand how pygame draws pictures (as known as blit). The player can press the left/right arrow keys or 'a'/'d' to move the background left and right. The program is an introduction towards scrolling games or platforms and its design was used in some of my games such as Flappy Bird.
